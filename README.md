> d.srupt is a multifunctional Discord bot built for and managed by students at Design Tech High School.

The bot:
- Manages server suggestions;
- Provides information about server/school-related activities;
- Creates "reaction roles," where server members can designate themselves under a particular interest group;
- Among other simple and convenient features!

This was my first Discord bot, and first foray into JavaScript. I've made a few mistakes — leaking an environment variable is not fun — but I've grown from it, and look forward to publishing more of my work!

*Built with [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs), a JavaScript library for interacting with Discord.*
